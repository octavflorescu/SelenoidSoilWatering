My Components:

- WDLuino UNO
- Led
- Diode
- Transistor
- Soil humidity sensor similar to https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13322, but from alibaba
- Solar panel system providing enough current to trigger the valve https://www.pni.ro/sistem-solar-fotovoltaic-pni-greenhouse-h01-30w-cu-acumulator-12v-7ah-usb-radio-mp3-2-becuri-led.html
